# App Brainstorming

## EcoSpotter
EcoSpotter would be a mobile app dedicated to raising environmental awareness. Users can report areas that need environmental attention, such as littered parks, polluted water bodies, or deforestation sites. The reports would be geotagged, and other users can verify them. The platform would gamify the cleaning process; users can form teams, take on challenges, and earn points for cleaning up areas.  

- Geotagged Reporting: Users can report environmental concerns with photos, descriptions, and exact location data.
- Real-time Monitoring: Dashboard where users can view real-time reports and coordinate responses.

For this app the dashboard would be the state that you are currently living on, it will be interactable and show alerts for the most trending environmental issue. In order to submit an environmental issue you need to upload at least 2 images and a short description of the issue. Every envirnomental issue will be grouped into clusters and then more specific as you zoom into the map. There will also be discussion board where people can coordinate and polls to decide of a day to go and try to resolve the issue.

## Travel Journel 
An interactive travel journal where users can document their journeys, plan future trips, and share travel experiences in a video form so it is easy to share in social media.

- Interactive Maps: As users input places they've been to or plan to visit, the app populates an interactive map, creating a visual representation of their travels.
- Journal Entries: Users can document their trips with photos, notes, and tags. They can also rate destinations, restaurants, and activities.

I don't want this application to be like google map's places. I want it to be memory export app that shows all your trips done either throughout the year or since you started posting. Application will ask to enable location services for photos so the user does not have to input the location manually. Simple interaction from picking photos then uploading them. Photos can be associated with instagram posts and notes can be added to individual photos.

## Book Trading
A app for book enthusiasts to trade physical books, discuss literature, and organize local reading clubs or events.

- Trade & Swap: Users can list books they're finished with and want to trade. They can browse other users' lists in their locality and make trade requests.
- Discussion Boards: Every book will have its discussion board where users can discuss plot points, character developments, and themes.

Book trading will be for niche traders as its only an app for book readers. The app will similar to OfferUp but with key differences. It will not be focused on buying. Mainly trading if another user has the book that the trader wants. If not trading then it will discussion boards for every book that is uploaded. Once added
